# 🏡 Linear Regression – Housing Price Prediction

This project demonstrates how to apply **Linear Regression** using `scikit-learn` to predict **housing prices** based on various numerical features from a dataset. It's a foundational supervised machine learning project ideal for beginners and interns learning regression analysis and model evaluation.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Implements **Simple and Multiple Linear Regression**
- Uses a real-world **Housing Dataset**
- Evaluates model performance using **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
- Includes **visualizations** (scatter plot, correlation heatmap)
- Predicts **house prices** using features like size, rooms, etc.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- `train.csv`: Training dataset containing features and target variable
- Features may include:
  - `LotArea`
  - `OverallQual`
  - `YearBuilt`
  - `TotalBsmtSF`
  - `GrLivArea`
  - `SalePrice` (target)

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/housing-price-prediction.git
cd housing-price-prediction
````

### 2. Install requirements

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### 3. Run the Python script

```bash
python linear_regression_housing.py
```

> ✅ Make sure `train.csv` is in the same folder.

## 📈 Evaluation Metric

* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** is used to measure prediction accuracy:

  $$
  RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{true} - y_{pred})^2}
  $$
